what an unthrift in the world doth spend\\r\\n  Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;\\r\\n  But beauty\\'s waste hath in the world an end,\\r\\n  And kept unused the user so destroys it.\\r\\n    No love toward others in that bosom sits\\r\\n    That on himself such murd\\'rous shame commits.\\r\\n\\r\\n  X\\r\\n\\r\\n  For shame! deny that thou bear\\'st love to any,\\r\\n  Who for thy self art so unprovident.\\r\\n  Grant, if thou wilt, thou art belov\\'d of many,\\r\\n  But that thou none lov\\'st is most evident:\\r\\n  For thou art so possess\\'d with murderous hate,\\r\\n  That \\'gainst thy self thou stick\\'st not to conspire,\\r\\n  Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate\\r\\n  Which to repair should be thy chief desire.\\r\\n  O! change thy thought, that I may change my mind:\\r\\n  Shall hate be fairer lodg\\'d than gentle love?\\r\\n  Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,\\r\\n  Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:\\r\\n    Make thee another self for love of me,\\r\\n    That beauty still may live in thine or thee.\\r\\n\\r\\n  XI\\r\\n\\r\\n  As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow\\'st,\\r\\n  In one of thine, from that which thou departest;\\r\\n  And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow\\'st,\\r\\n  Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest,\\r\\n  Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase;\\r\\n  Without this folly, age, and cold decay:\\r\\n  If all were minded so, the times should cease\\r\\n  And threescore year would make the world away.\\r\\n  Let those whom nature hath not made for store,\\r\\n  Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:\\r\\n  Look, whom she best endow\\'d, she gave thee more;\\r\\n  Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:\\r\\n    She carv\\'d thee for her seal, and meant thereby,\\r\\n    Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.\\r\\n\\r\\n  XII\\r\\n\\r\\n  When I do count the clock that tells the time,\\r\\n  And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;\\r\\n  When I behold the violet past prime,\\r\\n  And sable curls, all silvered o\\'er with white;\\r\\n  When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,\\r\\n  Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,\\r\\n  And summer\\'s green all girded up in sheaves,\\r\\n  Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,\\r\\n  Then of thy beauty do I question make,\\r\\n  That thou among the wastes of time must go,\\r\\n  Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake\\r\\n  And die as fast as they see others grow;\\r\\n    And nothing \\'gainst Time\\'s scythe can make defence\\r\\n    Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.\\r\\n\\r\\n  XIII\\r\\n\\r\\n  O! that you were your self; but, love you are\\r\\n  No longer yours, than you your self here live:\\r\\n  Against this coming end you should prepare,\\r\\n  And your sweet semblance to some other give:\\r\\n  So should that beauty which you hold in lease\\r\\n  Find no determination; then you were\\r\\n  Yourself again, after yourself\\'s decease,\\r\\n  When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.\\r\\n  Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,\\r\\n  Which husbandry in honour might uphold,\\r\\n  Against the stormy gusts of winter\\'s day\\r\\n  And barren rage of death\\'s eternal cold?\\r\\n    O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know,\\r\\n    You had a father: let your son say so.\\r\\n\\r\\n  XIV\\r\\n\\r\\n  Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck;\\r\\n  And yet methinks I have astronomy,\\r\\n  But not to tell of good or evil luck,\\r\\n  Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons\\' quality;\\r\\n  Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,\\r\\n  Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,\\r\\n  Or say with princes if it shall go well\\r\\n  By oft predict that I in heaven find:\\r\\n  But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,\\r\\n  And constant stars in them I read such art\\r\\n  As \\'Truth and beauty shall together thrive,\\r\\n  If from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert\\';\\r\\n    Or else of thee this I prognosticate:\\r\\n    \\'Thy end is truth\\'s and beauty\\'s doom and date.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n  XV\\r\\n\\r\\n  When I consider every thing that grows\\r\\n  Holds in perfection but a little moment,\\r\\n  That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows\\r\\n  Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;\\r\\n  When I perceive that men as plants increase,\\r\\n  Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky,\\r\\n  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,\\r\\n  And wear their brave state out of memory;\\r\\n  Then the conceit of this inconstant stay\\r\\n  Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,\\r\\n  Where wasteful Time debateth with decay\\r\\n  To change your day of youth to sullied night,\\r\\n    And all in war with Time for love of you,\\r\\n    As he takes from you, I engraft you new.\\r\\n\\r\\n  XVI\\r\\n\\r\\n  But wherefore do not you a mightier way\\r\\n  Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?\\r\\n  And fortify your self in your decay\\r\\n  With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?\\r\\n  Now stand you on the top of happy hours,\\r\\n  And many maiden gardens, yet unset,\\r\\n  With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,\\r\\n  Much liker than your painted counterfeit:\\r\\n  So should the lines of life that life repair,\\r\\n  Which this, Time\\'s pencil, or my pupil pen,\\r\\n  Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,\\r\\n  Can make you live your self in eyes of men.\\r\\n    To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,\\r\\n    And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.\\r\\n\\r\\n  XVII\\r\\n\\r\\n  Who will believe my verse in time to come,\\r\\n  If it were fill\\'d with your most high deserts?\\r\\n  Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb\\r\\n  Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts.\\r\\n  If I could write the beauty of your eyes,\\r\\n  And in fresh numbers number all your graces,\\r\\n  The age to come would say \\'This poet lies;\\r\\n  Such heavenly touches ne\\'er touch\\'d earthly faces.\\'\\r\\n  So should my papers, yellow\\'d with their age,\\r\\n  Be scorn\\'d, like old men of less truth than tongue,\\r\\n  And your true rights be term\\'d a poet\\'s rage\\r\\n  And stretched metre of an antique song:\\r\\n    But were some child of yours alive that time,\\r\\n    You should live twice,--in it, and in my rhyme.\\r\\n\\r\\n  XVIII\\r\\n\\r\\n  Shall I compare thee to a summer\\'s day?\\r\\n  Thou art more lovely and more temperate:\\r\\n  Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\\r\\n  And summer\\'s lease hath all too short a date:\\r\\n  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\\r\\n  And often is his gold complexion dimm\\'d,\\r\\n  And every fair from fair sometime declines,\\r\\n  By chance, or nature\\'s changing course untrimm\\'d:\\r\\n  But thy eternal summer shall not fade,\\r\\n  Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow\\'st,\\r\\n  Nor shall death brag thou wander\\'st in his shade,\\r\\n  When in eternal lines to time thou grow\\'st,\\r\\n    So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,\\r\\n    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.\\r\\n\\r\\n  XIX\\r\\n\\r\\n  Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion\\'s paws,\\r\\n  And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;\\r\\n  Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger\\'s jaws,\\r\\n  And burn the long-liv\\'d phoenix, in her blood;\\r\\n  Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,\\r\\n  And do whate\\'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,\\r\\n  To the wide world and all her fading sweets;\\r\\n  But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:\\r\\n  O! carve not with thy hours my love\\'s fair brow,\\r\\n  Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;\\r\\n  Him in thy course untainted do allow\\r\\n  For beauty\\'s pattern to succeeding men.\\r\\n    Yet, do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,\\r\\n    My love shall in my verse ever live young.\\r\\n\\r\\n  XX\\r\\n\\r\\n  A woman\\'s face with nature\\'s own hand painted,\\r\\n  Hast thou, the master mistress of my passion;\\r\\n  A woman\\'s gentle heart, but not acquainted\\r\\n  With shifting change, as is false women\\'s fashion:\\r\\n  An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,\\r\\n  Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;\\r\\n  A man in hue all \\'hues\\' in his controlling,\\r\\n  Which steals men\\'s eyes and women\\'s souls amazeth.\\r\\n  And for a woman wert thou first created;\\r\\n  Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,\\r\\n  And by addition me of thee defeated,\\r\\n  By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.\\r\\n    But since she prick\\'d thee out for women\\'s pleasure,\\r\\n    Mine be thy love and thy love\\'s use their treasure.\\r\\n\\r\\n  XXI\\r\\n\\r\\n  So is it not with me as with that Muse,\\r\\n  Stirr\\'d by a painted beauty to his verse,\\r\\n  Who heaven itself for ornament doth use\\r\\n  And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,\\r\\n  Making a couplement of proud compare.\\r\\n  With sun and moon, with earth and sea\\'s rich gems,\\r\\n  With April\\'s first-born flowers, and all things rare,\\r\\n  That heaven\\'s air in this huge rondure hems.\\r\\n  O! let me, true in love, but truly write,\\r\\n  And then believe me, my love is as fair\\r\\n  As any mother\\'s child, though not so bright\\r\\n  As those gold candles fix\\'d in heaven\\'s air:\\r\\n    Let them say more that like of hearsay well;\\r\\n    I will not praise that purpose not to sell.\\r\\n\\r\\n  XXII\\r\\n\\r\\n  My glass shall not persuade me I am old,\\r\\n  So long as youth and thou are of one date;\\r\\n  But when in thee time\\'s furrows I behold,\\r\\n  Then look I death my days should expiate.\\r\\n  For all that beauty that doth cover thee,\\r\\n  Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,\\r\\n  Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:\\r\\n  How can I then be elder than thou art?\\r\\n  O! therefore love, be of thyself so wary\\r\\n  As I, not for myself, but for thee will;\\r\\n  Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary\\r\\n  As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.\\r\\n    Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,\\r\\n    Thou gav\\'st me thine not to give back again.\\r\\n\\r\\n  XXIII\\r\\n\\r\\n  As an unperfect actor on the stage,\\r\\n  Who with his fear is put beside his part,\\r\\n  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,\\r\\n  Whose strength\\'s abundance weakens his own heart;\\r\\n  So I, for fear of trust, forget to say\\r\\n  The perfect ceremony of love\\'s rite,\\r\\n  And in mine own love\\'s strength seem to decay,\\r\\n  O\\'ercharg\\'d with burthen of mine own love\\'s might.\\r\\n  O!

seen,\\r\\n  Without all ornament, itself and true,\\r\\n  Making no summer of another\\'s green,\\r\\n  Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;\\r\\n    And him as for a map doth Nature store,\\r\\n    To show false Art what beauty was of yore.\\r\\n\\r\\n  LXIX\\r\\n\\r\\n  Those parts of thee that the world\\'s eye doth view\\r\\n  Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;\\r\\n  All tongues--the voice of souls--give thee that due,\\r\\n  Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.\\r\\n  Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown\\'d;\\r\\n  But those same tongues, that give thee so thine own,\\r\\n  In other accents do this praise confound\\r\\n  By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.\\r\\n  They look into the beauty of thy mind,\\r\\n  And that in guess they measure by thy deeds;\\r\\n  Then--churls--their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,\\r\\n  To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:\\r\\n    But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,\\r\\n    The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.\\r\\n\\r\\n  LXX\\r\\n\\r\\n  That thou art blam\\'d shall not be thy defect,\\r\\n  For slander\\'s mark was ever yet the fair;\\r\\n  The ornament of beauty is suspect,\\r\\n  A crow that flies in heaven\\'s sweetest air.\\r\\n  So thou be good, slander doth but approve\\r\\n  Thy worth the greater being woo\\'d of time;\\r\\n  For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,\\r\\n  And thou present\\'st a pure unstained prime.\\r\\n  Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days\\r\\n  Either not assail\\'d, or victor being charg\\'d;\\r\\n  Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,\\r\\n  To tie up envy, evermore enlarg\\'d,\\r\\n    If some suspect of ill mask\\'d not thy show,\\r\\n    Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.\\r\\n\\r\\n  LXXI\\r\\n\\r\\n  No longer mourn for me when I am dead\\r\\n  Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell\\r\\n  Give warning to the world that I am fled\\r\\n  From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:\\r\\n  Nay, if you read this line, remember not\\r\\n  The hand that writ it, for I love you so,\\r\\n  That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,\\r\\n  If thinking on me then should make you woe.\\r\\n  O! if,--I say you look upon this verse,\\r\\n  When I perhaps compounded am with clay,\\r\\n  Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;\\r\\n  But let your love even with my life decay;\\r\\n    Lest the wise world should look into your moan,\\r\\n    And mock you with me after I am gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n  LXXII\\r\\n\\r\\n  O! lest the world should task you to recite\\r\\n  What merit lived in me, that you should love\\r\\n  After my death,--dear love, forget me quite,\\r\\n  For you in me can nothing worthy prove;\\r\\n  Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,\\r\\n  To do more for me than mine own desert,\\r\\n  And hang more praise upon deceased I\\r\\n  Than niggard truth would willingly impart:\\r\\n  O! lest your true love may seem false in this\\r\\n  That you for love speak well of me untrue,\\r\\n  My name be buried where my body is,\\r\\n  And live no more to shame nor me nor you.\\r\\n    For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,\\r\\n    And so should you, to love things nothing worth.\\r\\n\\r\\n  LXXIII\\r\\n\\r\\n  That time of year thou mayst in me behold\\r\\n  When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang\\r\\n  Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,\\r\\n  Bare ruin\\'d choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.\\r\\n  In me thou see\\'st the twilight of such day\\r\\n  As after sunset fadeth in the west;\\r\\n  Which by and by black night doth take away,\\r\\n  Death\\'s second self, that seals up all in rest.\\r\\n  In me thou see\\'st the glowing of such fire,\\r\\n  That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,\\r\\n  As the death-bed, whereon it must expire,\\r\\n  Consum\\'d with that which it was nourish\\'d by.\\r\\n    This thou perceiv\\'st, which makes thy love more strong,\\r\\n    To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.\\r\\n\\r\\n  LXXIV\\r\\n\\r\\n  But be contented: when that fell arrest\\r\\n  Without all bail shall carry me away,\\r\\n  My life hath in this line some interest,\\r\\n  Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.\\r\\n  When thou reviewest this, thou dost review\\r\\n  The very part was consecrate to thee:\\r\\n  The earth can have but earth, which is his due;\\r\\n  My spirit is thine, the better part of me:\\r\\n  So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,\\r\\n  The prey of worms, my body being dead;\\r\\n  The coward conquest of a wretch\\'s knife,\\r\\n  Too base of thee to be remembered.\\r\\n    The worth of that is that which it contains,\\r\\n    And that is this, and this with thee remains.\\r\\n\\r\\n  LXXV\\r\\n\\r\\n  So are you to my thoughts as food to life,\\r\\n  Or as sweet-season\\'d showers are to the ground;\\r\\n  And for the peace of you I hold such strife\\r\\n  As \\'twixt a miser and his wealth is found.\\r\\n  Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon\\r\\n  Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure;\\r\\n  Now counting best to be with you alone,\\r\\n  Then better\\'d that the world may see my pleasure:\\r\\n  Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,\\r\\n  And by and by clean starved for a look;\\r\\n  Possessing or pursuing no delight,\\r\\n  Save what is had, or must from you be took.\\r\\n    Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,\\r\\n    Or gluttoning on all, or all away.\\r\\n\\r\\n  LXXVI\\r\\n\\r\\n  Why is my verse so barren of new pride,\\r\\n  So far from variation or quick change?\\r\\n  Why with the time do I not glance aside\\r\\n  To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?\\r\\n  Why write I still all one, ever the same,\\r\\n  And keep invention in a noted weed,\\r\\n  That every word doth almost tell my name,\\r\\n  Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?\\r\\n  O! know sweet love I always write of you,\\r\\n  And you and love are still my argument;\\r\\n  So all my best is dressing old words new,\\r\\n  Spending again what is already spent:\\r\\n    For as the sun is daily new and old,\\r\\n    So is my love still telling what is told.\\r\\n\\r\\n  LXXVII\\r\\n\\r\\n  Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,\\r\\n  Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;\\r\\n  These vacant leaves thy mind\\'s imprint will bear,\\r\\n  And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.\\r\\n  The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show\\r\\n  Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;\\r\\n  Thou by thy dial\\'s shady stealth mayst know\\r\\n  Time\\'s thievish progress to eternity.\\r\\n  Look! what thy memory cannot contain,\\r\\n  Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find\\r\\n  Those children nursed, deliver\\'d from thy brain,\\r\\n  To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.\\r\\n    These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,\\r\\n    Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.\\r\\n\\r\\n  LXXVIII\\r\\n\\r\\n  So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse,\\r\\n  And found such fair assistance in my verse\\r\\n  As every alien pen hath got my use\\r\\n  And under thee their poesy disperse.\\r\\n  Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing\\r\\n  And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,\\r\\n  Have added feathers to the learned\\'s wing\\r\\n  And given grace a double majesty.\\r\\n  Yet be most proud of that which I compile,\\r\\n  Whose influence is thine, and born of thee:\\r\\n  In others\\' works thou dost but mend the style,\\r\\n  And arts with thy sweet graces graced be;\\r\\n    But thou art all my art, and dost advance\\r\\n    As high as learning, my rude ignorance.\\r\\n\\r\\n  LXXIX\\r\\n\\r\\n  Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,\\r\\n  My verse alone had all thy gentle grace;\\r\\n  But now my gracious numbers are decay\\'d,\\r\\n  And my sick Muse doth give an other place.\\r\\n  I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument\\r\\n  Deserves the travail of a worthier pen;\\r\\n  Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent\\r\\n  He robs thee of, and pays it thee again.\\r\\n  He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word\\r\\n  From thy behaviour; beauty doth he give,\\r\\n  And found it in thy cheek: he can afford\\r\\n  No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.\\r\\n    Then thank him not for that which he doth say,\\r\\n    Since what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay.\\r\\n\\r\\n  LXXX\\r\\n\\r\\n  O! how I faint when I of you do write,\\r\\n  Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,\\r\\n  And in the praise thereof spends all his might,\\r\\n  To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame!\\r\\n  But since your worth--wide as the ocean is,--\\r\\n  The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,\\r\\n  My saucy bark, inferior far to his,\\r\\n  On your broad main doth wilfully appear.\\r\\n  Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,\\r\\n  Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;\\r\\n  Or, being wrack\\'d, I am a worthless boat,\\r\\n  He of tall building, and of goodly pride:\\r\\n    Then if he thrive and I be cast away,\\r\\n    The worst was this,--my love was my decay.\\r\\n\\r\\n  LXXXI\\r\\n\\r\\n  Or I shall live your epitaph to make,\\r\\n  Or you survive when I in earth am rotten;\\r\\n  From hence your memory death cannot take,\\r\\n  Although in me each part will be forgotten.\\r\\n  Your name from hence immortal life shall have,\\r\\n  Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:\\r\\n  The earth can yield me but a common grave,\\r\\n  When you entombed in men\\'s eyes shall lie.\\r\\n  Your monument shall be my gentle verse,\\r\\n  Which eyes not yet created shall o\\'er-read;\\r\\n  And tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,\\r\\n  When all the breathers of this world are dead;\\r\\n    You still shall live,--such virtue hath my pen,--\\r\\n    Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.\\r\\n\\r\\n  LXXXII\\r\\n\\r\\n  I grant thou wert not married to my Muse,\\r\\n  And therefore mayst without attaint o\\'erlook\\r\\n  The dedicated words which writers use\\r\\n  Of their fair subject, blessing every book.\\r\\n  Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,\\r\\n  Finding thy worth a limit past my praise;\\r\\n  And therefore art enforced to seek anew\\r\\n  Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.\\r\\n  And do so, love; yet when they have devis\\'d,\\r\\n  What strained touches rhetoric can lend,\\r\\n  Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathiz\\'d\\r\\n  In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend;\\r\\n    And their gross painting might be better us\\'d\\r\\n    Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abus\\'d.\\r\\n\\r\\n  LXXXIII\\r\\n\\r\\n  I never saw that you did painting need,\\r\\n  And therefore to your fair no painting set;\\r\\n  I found, or thought I found, you did exceed\\r\\n  That barren tender of a poet\\'s debt:\\r\\n  And therefore have I slept in your report,\\r\\n  That you yourself, being extant, well might show\\r\\n  How far a modern quill doth come too short,\\r\\n  Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.\\r\\n  This silence for my sin you did impute,\\r\\n  Which shall be most my glory being dumb;\\r\\n  For I impair not beauty being mute,\\r\\n  When others would give life, and bring a tomb.\\r\\n    There lives more life in one of your fair eyes\\r\\n    Than both your poets can in praise devise.\\r\\n\\r\\n  LXXXIV\\r\\n\\r\\n  Who is it that says most, which can say more,\\r\\n  Than this rich praise,--that you alone, are you?\\r\\n  In whose confine immured is the store\\r\\n  Which should example where your equal grew.\\r\\n  Lean penury within that pen doth dwell\\r\\n  That to his subject lends not some small glory;\\r\\n  But he that writes of you, if he can tell\\r\\n  That you are you, so dignifies his story,\\r\\n  Let him but copy what in you is writ,\\r\\n  Not making worse what nature made so clear,\\r\\n  And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,\\r\\n  Making his style admired every where.\\r\\n    You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,\\r\\n    Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.\\r\\n\\r\\n  LXXXV\\r\\n\\r\\n  My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,\\r\\n  While comments of your praise richly compil\\'d,\\r\\n  Reserve their character with golden quill,\\r\\n  And precious phrase by all the Muses fil\\'d.\\r\\n  I think good thoughts, whilst others write good words,\\r\\n  And like unlettered clerk still cry \\'Amen\\'\\r\\n  To every hymn that able spirit affords,\\r\\n  In polish\\'d form of well-refined pen.\\r\\n  Hearing you praised, I say \\'\\'tis so, \\'tis true,\\'\\r\\n  And to the most of praise add something more;\\r\\n  But that is in my thought, whose love to you,\\r\\n  Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.\\r\\n    Then others, for the breath of words respect,\\r\\n    Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.\\r\\n\\r\\n  LXXXVI\\r\\n\\r\\n  Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,\\r\\n  Bound for the prize of all too precious you,\\r\\n  That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,\\r\\n  Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?\\r\\n  Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,\\r\\n  Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?\\r\\n  No, neither he, nor his compeers by night\\r\\n  Giving him aid, my verse astonished.\\r\\n  He, nor that affable familiar ghost\\r\\n  Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,\\r\\n  As victors of my silence cannot boast;\\r\\n  I was not sick of any fear from thence:\\r\\n    But when your countenance fill\\'d up his line,\\r\\n    Then lacked I matter; that enfeebled mine.\\r\\n\\r\\n  LXXXVII\\r\\n\\r\\n  Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,\\r\\n  And like enough thou know\\'st thy estimate,\\r\\n  The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;\\r\\n  My bonds in thee are all determinate.\\r\\n  For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?\\r\\n  And for that riches where is my deserving?\\r\\n  The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,\\r\\n  And so my patent back again is swerving.\\r\\n  Thy self thou gav\\'st, thy own worth then not knowing,\\r\\n  Or me to whom thou gav\\'st it, else mistaking;\\r\\n  So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,\\r\\n  Comes home again, on better judgement making.\\r\\n    Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,\\r\\n    In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.\\r\\n\\r\\n  LXXXVIII\\r\\n\\r\\n  When thou shalt be dispos\\'d to set me light,\\r\\n  And place my merit in the eye of scorn,\\r\\n  Upon thy side, against myself I\\'ll fight,\\r\\n  And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.\\r\\n  With mine own weakness, being best acquainted,\\r\\n  Upon thy part I can set down a story\\r\\n  Of faults conceal\\'d, wherein I am attainted;\\r\\n  That thou in losing me shalt win much glory:\\r\\n  And I by this will be a gainer too;\\r\\n  For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,\\r\\n  The injuries that to myself I do,\\r\\n  Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.\\r\\n    Such is my love, to thee I so belong,\\r\\n    That for thy right, myself will bear all wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\n  LXXXIX\\r\\n\\r\\n  Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,\\r\\n  And I will comment upon that offence:\\r\\n  Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt,\\r\\n  Against thy reasons making no defence.\\r\\n  Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill,\\r\\n  To set a form upon desired change,\\r\\n  As I\\'ll myself disgrace; knowing thy will,\\r\\n  I will acquaintance strangle, and look strange;\\r\\n  Be absent from thy walks; and in my tongue\\r\\n  Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,\\r\\n  Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong,\\r\\n  And haply of our old acquaintance tell.\\r\\n    For thee, against my self I\\'ll vow debate,\\r\\n    For I must ne\\'er love him whom thou dost hate.\\r\\n\\r\\n  XC\\r\\n\\r\\n  Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;\\r\\n  Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,\\r\\n  Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,\\r\\n  And do not drop in for an after-loss:\\r\\n  Ah! do not, when my heart hath \\'scap\\'d this sorrow,\\r\\n  Come in the rearward of a conquer\\'d woe;\\r\\n  Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,\\r\\n  To linger out a purpos\\'d overthrow.\\r\\n  If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,\\r\\n  When other petty griefs have done their spite,\\r\\n  But in the onset come: so shall I taste\\r\\n  At first the very worst of fortune\\'s might;\\r\\n    And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,\\r\\n    Compar\\'d with loss of thee, will not seem so.\\r\\n\\r\\n  XCI\\r\\n\\r\\n  Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,\\r\\n  Some in their wealth, some in their body\\'s force,\\r\\n  Some in their garments though new-fangled ill;\\r\\n  Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;\\r\\n  And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,\\r\\n  Wherein it finds a joy above the rest:\\r\\n  But these particulars are not my measure,\\r\\n  All these I better in one general best.\\r\\n  Thy love is better than high birth to me,\\r\\n  Richer than wealth, prouder than garments\\' costs,\\r\\n  Of more delight than hawks and horses be;\\r\\n  And having thee, of all men\\'s pride I boast:\\r\\n    Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take\\r\\n    All this away, and me most wretchcd make.\\r\\n\\r\\n  XCII\\r\\n\\r\\n  But do thy worst to steal thyself away,\\r\\n  For term of life thou art assured mine;\\r\\n  And life no longer than thy love will stay,\\r\\n  For it depends upon that love of thine.\\r\\n  Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,\\r\\n  When in the least of them my life hath end.\\r\\n  I see a better state to me belongs\\r\\n  Than that which on thy humour doth depend:\\r\\n  Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,\\r\\n  Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.\\r\\n  O! what a happy title do I find,\\r\\n  Happy to have thy love, happy to die!\\r\\n    But what\\'s so blessed-fair that fears no blot?\\r\\n    Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.\\r\\n\\r\\n  XCIII\\r\\n\\r\\n  So shall I live, supposing thou art true,\\r\\n  Like a deceived husband; so love\\'s face\\r\\n  May still seem love to me, though alter\\'d new;\\r\\n  Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place:\\r\\n  For there can live no hatred in thine eye,\\r\\n  Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.\\r\\n  In many\\'s looks, the false heart\\'s history\\r\\n  Is writ in moods, and frowns, and wrinkles strange.\\r\\n  But heaven in thy creation did decree\\r\\n  That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;\\r\\n  Whate\\'er thy thoughts, or thy heart\\'s workings be,\\r\\n  Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.\\r\\n    How like Eve\\'s apple doth thy beauty grow,\\r\\n    If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!\\r\\n\\r\\n  XCIV\\r\\n\\r\\n  They that have power to hurt, and will do none,\\r\\n  That do not do the thing they most do show,\\r\\n  Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,\\r\\n  Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow;\\r\\n  They rightly do inherit heaven\\'s graces,\\r\\n  And husband nature\\'s riches from expense;\\r\\n  They are the lords and owners of their faces,\\r\\n  Others, but stewards of their excellence.\\r\\n  The summer\\'s flower is to the summer sweet,\\r\\n  Though to itself, it only live and die,\\r\\n  But if that flower with base infection meet,\\r\\n  The basest weed outbraves his dignity:\\r\\n    For

canker in the fragrant rose,\\r\\n  Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!\\r\\n  O! in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose.\\r\\n  That tongue that tells the story of thy days,\\r\\n  Making lascivious comments on thy sport,\\r\\n  Cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise;\\r\\n  Naming thy name, blesses an ill report.\\r\\n  O! what a mansion have those vices got\\r\\n  Which for their habitation chose out thee,\\r\\n  Where beauty\\'s veil doth cover every blot\\r\\n  And all things turns to fair that eyes can see!\\r\\n    Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;\\r\\n    The hardest knife ill-us\\'d doth lose his edge.\\r\\n\\r\\n  XCVI\\r\\n\\r\\n  Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;\\r\\n  Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;\\r\\n  Both grace and faults are lov\\'d of more and less:\\r\\n  Thou mak\\'st faults graces that to thee resort.\\r\\n  As on the finger of a throned queen\\r\\n  The basest jewel will be well esteem\\'d,\\r\\n  So are those errors that in thee are seen\\r\\n  To truths translated, and for true things deem\\'d.\\r\\n  How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,\\r\\n  If like a lamb he could his looks translate!\\r\\n  How many gazers mightst thou lead away,\\r\\n  if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!\\r\\n    But do not so; I love thee in such sort,\\r\\n    As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.\\r\\n\\r\\n  XCVII\\r\\n\\r\\n  How like a winter hath my absence been\\r\\n  From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!\\r\\n  What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!\\r\\n  What old December\\'s bareness everywhere!\\r\\n  And yet this time removed was summer\\'s time;\\r\\n  The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,\\r\\n  Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,\\r\\n  Like widow\\'d wombs after their lords\\' decease:\\r\\n  Yet this abundant issue seem\\'d to me\\r\\n  But hope of orphans, and unfather\\'d fruit;\\r\\n  For summer and his pleasures

XCVIII\\r\\n\\r\\n  From you have I been absent in the spring,\\r\\n  When proud-pied April, dress\\'d in all his trim,\\r\\n  Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,\\r\\n  That heavy Saturn laugh\\'d and leap\\'d with him.\\r\\n  Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell\\r\\n  Of different flowers in odour and in hue,\\r\\n  Could make me any summer\\'s story tell,\\r\\n  Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:\\r\\n  Nor did I wonder at the lily\\'s white,\\r\\n  Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;\\r\\n  They were but sweet, but figures of delight,\\r\\n

Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable\\r\\neffort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread\\r\\npublic domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\ncollection.

LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the \"Right\\r\\nof Replacement or Refund\" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all\\r\\nliability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal\\r\\nfees.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\r\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\r\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\r\\npeople in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\r\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\r\\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\r\\nFoundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\r\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\r\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\r\\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\\r\\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email\\r\\ncontact links and up to date contact information can be found at the\\r\\nFoundation\\'s web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\r\\n\\r\\nFor additional contact information:\\r\\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\r\\n     Chief Executive and Director\\r\\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\r\\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\r\\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\r\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\r\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\r\\n\\r\\n     www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n'"
